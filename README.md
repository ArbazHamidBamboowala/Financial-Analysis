This Project is a sample of my work where I had wokred on a project to analyze Bank Data using Tableau.

I developed this Financial Dashboard using Tableau, utilizing a sample dataset from a bank spanning from 2011 to 2022. 
This dataset includes all customer complaints filed during this period, categorized by state.

In my analysis, I focused on key performance indicators (KPIs) related to complaints by product. 
Given the high volume of unresolved complaints over the years, prioritizing them presented a challenge. 
The dashboard revealed that credit card complaints were the most prevalent, exceeding 19,000. 
Additionally, nearly 50% of the complaints were related to media channels.

To enhance our complaint resolution process, I recommended prioritizing the resolution of the most frequent complaints first. 
This strategy proved effective in streamlining our operations. 
Furthermore, the analysis highlighted that the majority of issues were associated with account management. 
In response, I proposed updating our banking system with a new application designed to facilitate easier deposits and withdrawals from other accounts.
